# <YOUR_RECIPE_AGENT_SAAS>

Built with [Wasp](https://wasp.sh) and [Mastra AI](https://mastra.ai), based on the [Open Saas](https://opensaas.sh) template.

## Development

### Running locally

 - Make sure you have [Wasp](https://wasp.sh) installed:
 ```bash
 curl -sSL https://get.wasp.sh/installer.sh | sh
 ```
 - Copy the `.env.client` and `.env.server` files:
```bash
cp .env.server.example .env.server && cp .env.client.example .env.client
```
 - Run the database and leave it running (docker must be installed and running):
 ```bash
 wasp start db
 ```
 - Start the wasp app and leave it running:
 ```bash
 wasp start
 ```
 - If this is the first time starting the app, or you've just made changes to your entities/prisma schema, also run:
 ```bash
 wasp db migrate-dev
 ```
 - Fill in the needed env vars in the `.env.server` file:
  - AWS S3 credentials
  - OpenAI API key
